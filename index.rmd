I am a Post Doctoral researcher (2021-present) at the Medische microbiologie en infectiepreventie, Groningen and The Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu). I am working on various aspects (immunological, microbiological, etc.) of vaccine response in elderly subjects.  
Previously, I was a Post Doctoral researcher (2019-2020) in the Laboratory of Microbiology at the Wageningen University & Research (MIB-WUR). At MIB-WUR, my research is focused on investigating the ecological and physiological aspects of the human intestinal tract microbiome using synthetic microbiomes. From 2014 until 2019, I did my PhD research with Willem M. De Vos and Hauke Smidt (Laboratory of Microbiology at the Wageningen University & Research) and Leo Lahti (Open Research Labs, University of Turku).
