My research interests is in understanding the role of human microbiome in health and harness its potential for developing microbiome based diagnostics and therapeutics. Microbiome research is increasingly becoming a data driven field and I combine my academic training in microbiology with my skills in microbiome data science to   

* Understand the role of human microbiome in health and disease  
* Develop open source tools to facilitate microbiome data analytics  

During my Ph.D. and Post-Doc stint at the Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University and Research, I combined anaerobic microbiology with multiple -omics approaches to investigate the interactions between gut microbes using synthetic minimal microbiomes.     
Currently, I am a Post-Doc at the Dept. of Medical Microbiology and Infection Prevention, University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) and a guest researcher at the Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). My research is aimed at identifying microbial and immune biomarkers of viral infection and vaccine responsiveness. I also contribute with my expertise in microbiome data analytics on several projects using animal models of respiratory viral infections to understand the role of microbiome.  

Apart from research, I enjoy academic mentoring and teaching, creating acrylic paintings and consider my self an amateur chef.
