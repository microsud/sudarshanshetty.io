Shetty\"\n---\n\n\nMy research interests is in understanding the role of human microbiome in health and harness its potential for developing microbiome based diagnostics and therapeutics. Microbiome research is increasingly becoming a data driven field and I combine my academic training in microbiology with my skills in microbiome data science to\n\n\\* Understand the role of human microbiome in health and disease\n\n\\* Develop open source tools to facilitate microbiome data analytics\n\nI received my PhD in Human gut microbiology at the Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University and Research, with Prof. dr. Willem M De Vos, Prof. dr. Hauke Smidt and Prof. dr. Leo Lahti. I studied the human gut microbiome at multiple levels from single bacterium, synthetic microbiomes to ecosystem level. Together with Leo Lahti, I have co-developed R packages for microbiome data analysis that are widely used in microbiome research.\n\nApart from research, I enjoy creating acrylic paintings and consider my self an amateur chef.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n1 + 1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
