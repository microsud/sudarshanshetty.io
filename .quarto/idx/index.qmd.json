I have >9 years of experience in human microbiome research. In these years, I have acquired skills in experimental design, anaerobic microbiology, multi-omics data analytics, tool development and led collaborative projects.  \n\nI received my PhD in Human gut microbiology at the Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University and Research, with Prof. dr. Willem M De Vos, Prof. dr. Hauke Smidt and Prof. dr. Leo Lahti. I studied the human gut microbiome at multiple levels from single bacterium, synthetic microbiomes to ecosystem level. Together with Leo Lahti, I have co-developed R packages that are widely used in microbiome research.  \n\nApart from research, I enjoy creating acrylic paintings and consider my self an amateur chef.\n\n\n\n* February 2021 - February 2023      \nPost Doctoral Researcher at Medische microbiologie en infectiepreventie, Groningen and The Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu).   \n\n* February 2020 - Jan 2021  \nPost Doctoral Researcher at University Medical Center, Utrecht and Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu).   \n•\tImmune response in elderly subjects receiving vaccine(s).
