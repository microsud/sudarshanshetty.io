I'm a microbiome scientist interested in exploring the potential of microbiome in improving health and well-being. I have >9 years of experience in human microbiome research. In these years, I have acquired skills in experimental design, anaerobic microbiology, multi-omics data analytics, tool development and led collaborative projects.  

I received my PhD in Human gut microbiology at the Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University and Research, with Prof. dr. Willem M De Vos, Prof. dr. Hauke Smidt and Prof. dr. Leo Lahti. I studied the human gut microbiome at multiple levels from single bacterium, synthetic microbiomes to ecosystem level. Together with Leo Lahti, I have co-developed R packages that are widely used in microbiome research.  

Apart from research, I enjoy creating acrylic paintings and consider my self an amateur chef.


## Experience  

* February 2021 - February 2023      
Post Doctoral Researcher at Medische microbiologie en infectiepreventie, Groningen and The Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu).   

* February 2020 - Jan 2021  
Post Doctoral Researcher at University Medical Center, Utrecht and Netherlands National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu).   
•	Immune response in elderly subjects receiving vaccine(s). Investigation of various immune parameters and microbiota.      

* March 2019 - Jan 2020  
Post Doctoral Researcher at Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University and Research.  
•	Design and development of synthetic human gut microbiomes.  
•	Developing multi-omics integrative biodiscovery pipelines for efficient utilization of synthetic microbiomes in a variety of biotech applications.  

* August 2014 - March 2019  	  
PhD, Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University and Research.  
•	Used a combination of genomics, proteomics and anaerobic culturing to elucidate the physiology of core human intestinal bacteria.  
•	Used a combination of in-silico and in-vitro approach to develop a defined consortium of human intestinal microbiome.  
•	Developed analytical pipelines in R for high-throughput sequencing data (primarily 16S rRNA gene amplicon).    

* June 2012 - June 2014	 	
Junior Research Fellow, National Centre for Cell Science.
