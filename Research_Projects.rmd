**Ecophysiology of Core Human Intestinal Bacteria**  
In this project, we aim to understand the physiology and role of the core bacteria that have been identified by us. We use basic anaerobic microbiology techniques supported by genomics, proteomics and may be also transcriptomics. The goal here is to better understand these microbes before they can be used to next generation of therapeutic. For more details please click on the [link](https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/femsre/fuw045) to check the publication for a list of interesting core bacteria in human gut.

**Towards minimal microbiome**  
In this study, we aim to study ecological and physiological dynamics of key bacterial strains in defined microbial communities. We also aim to address challenges in data acquisition, integration and visualization in such studies. The combination of multi-omics and basic anaerobic physiology is expected to give crucial insights into the resilience, stability and functional networks under well defined growth condtions.   
For more details please check our review [Reconstructing functional networks in the human intestinal tract using synthetic microbiomes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166918302301).
